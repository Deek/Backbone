INSTALLING BACKBONE
~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~

If you're trying to build Backbone from a source code repository (and, let's 
be honest, you almost certainly are), you'll need the following packages:

GNU autoconf 2.60a or later.
gnustep-make
gnustep-base
gnustep-gui

On some systems (like Solaris), you may need:

GNU libiconv

The basic process for building and installing Backbone is: 

cd System
./bootstrap && ./configure && make && sudo make install

'bootstrap' is a simple script used to run autoconf and some of its tools,
which in turn create the 'configure' script, which Backbone uses to figure
out what kind of system you have, where your GNUstep stuff is, and so on.

Any errors should be reported to Jeff Teunissen <deek@d2dc.net>, who is
in charge of the build system.
