a terminal emulator for GNUstep


Terminal emulation
------------------

The terminal emulation code is based on Linux's console code, and nearly
all parts of it are handled. Thus, the TERM environment variable is set
to 'linux'. Additionally, 'vt100', 'vt220', 'xterm', and others similar
to these should mostly work. To distinguish Terminal.app from a 'real'
linux console, the environment variable TERM_PROGRAM is set to
'GNUstep_Terminal'.


The xterm extensions for setting the window's title are also supported.
You set the title using:

'\033]'+0, 1, or 2+';'+the title+'\007'

1 sets the miniwindow title, 2 sets the window title, and 0 sets both.

Example (from Jeff Teunissen):
 export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]2;Terminal - ${HOSTNAME}:${PWD}\007"'


[The terminal emulation code is fairly modular. If you want to write a
terminal emulation class for some other terminal, contact me and I'll
do the remaining cleanups necessary to load terminal emulation classes
from bundles.]
